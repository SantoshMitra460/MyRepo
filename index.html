    <p class = "secondpara">Wondering what the above text means? It is simply a sample garbage text built into this software called VS Code that I am using to write codes.
        As you don't always have a text paragraph ready in front of you to type. But when testing a page, this garbage sample text comes in handy and is quite 
        useful when doing web development work. Kudos to Microsoft for thinking of such a thing. Perhaps a border around this paragraph would look nice</p>
    
    <p class = "thirdpara">Lets take a look at the types of lists available in HTML</p>
    <p class = "fourthpara">First is an unordered list which is indicated with the "ul" tag What this basically means is, that whatever this list item will contain
        will not have numbering or ordering of any sort. If you want to know exactly what I mean, here is an example. Of course
         you will have to use the tags "ul" when declaring an unordered list. 
         The tag with the forward slash is known as an ending tag and the one that does not have 
         that is known as an opening tag. Please read on to find more. Oh! and by the way, you need 
         to use the "li" tags to indicate that this is a list. The tags won't be visible on the page that you are viewing, but if you right click on the page and select "View Source page" you will be able to see all the tags that have been used.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>India</li>
            <li>China</li>
            <li>France</li>
            <li>Germany</li>
        </ul>
    <p>As you can see above, the list is bulleted and has no numbering or ordering of any sort. It just has bullets. This is how an unordered list looks like.</p> 
    <p>Just in case you are curious to know what the code looks like for the page that you are viewing, right-click on any blank space on the page and choose the option "View Source Page" in the menu that appears. It will show you the entire html file and the linked CSS and Javascript files that have been used to create the page.</p> 
    <p>Now let's take a look at how an ordered list looks like in HTML. As you might have guessed, an ordered list is indicated using the <b>'ol'</b> tag. You can even specify the type of ordering that you want on your page. There are a few types of ordering as I have mentioned below:. To specify the type of ordering you just have to use the "type" attribute along with the ol tag. Let's see with a live example.
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Fish Curry</li>
        <li>Fries</li>
        <li>Meat Balls</li>
        <li>Chicken</li>
    </ol>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Cricket</li>
        <li>Badminton</li>
        <li>Khokho</li>
        <li>Football</li>
    </ol>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>Malaysia</li>
        <li>Singapore</li>
        <li>Canada</li>
        <li>China</li>
    </ol>
    <ol type="i">
        <li>Colgate</li>
        <li>Sensodyne</li>
        <li>Aquafresh</li>
        <li>Dabur Red</li>
    </ol>
    <ol type="I">
        <li>Apples</li>&nbsp;<li>Mangoes</li>&nbsp;<li>Grapes</li>&nbsp;<li>Oranges</li>
        <p>Wondering why that big gap exists within the items that I just typed above. It is because I have used something called "a new blank space" tag indicated using the syntax "&nbsp;"</p>
    </ol>
    <p>So as you can see above, there are four different types of ordering that can be done using lists in HTML. You can of course choose your favorite method of ordering based on your needs and preferences.</p> 
    <p>Remember that marker pen you used in school? To highlight a certain part of your textbook with a bright green or yellow color? The same can be done in HTML as well. All you have to do is use the 'mark' tag. Somewhat like this:
        <mark>This text is chosen for marking</mark>. As you can see, the text is highlighted in yellow color. That is because it is included within the mark tags. The mark tag is useful when you have a large document to read and need to spot a certain section quickly when reading.
    I request you to view the source page as I have mentioned earlier, if you want to take a look at the code.</p> 
    </p>  
    <p class ="p1">A page consisting purely of text looks boring and unattractive. To make sure you page appeals to the user, you need to be able to style it so that it looks beautiful. There are two ways to do that. One is by using an inline CSS. Another one is by linking an external stylesheet. The latter is 
        preferred in most cases as it more convenient, but you can also use inline CSS if you want and don't want to harass yourself with the trouble of linking external style sheets. To use inline CSS, just use the style tags and then write your CSS code within those tags.
        <style>
            #p1
            {
                color:blue;
            }
        </style>
